# App-Shopping
This is a simple, interactive shopping cart application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to browse products, sign in, sign up, and add items to their cart. It also includes functionality to store user data and shopping cart information in the browser's `localStorage`, making the app persistent across sessions.
